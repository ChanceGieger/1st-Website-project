          <p>The Dire Wolf lived in both North and South America. Their remains have been found in plains, grasslands, and some forested mountain ranges of North America, and in the arid Savannah of South America. They have been rarely found about 25 degrees latitude. This could be beacuse of temperature, prey, or the limitaions imposed by the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets that existed at the time.</p>
